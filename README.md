# AnomalyHotSpots
Just-in-Time detection of crime sprees.

#The Opportunity
Traditional hot spot analyses often identify the same high-crime areas known by seasoned officers, offering little new insight. However, our Police Service needed a tool to detect unusual crime spikes—emerging hot spots that fall outside of these predictable patterns—enabling officers to respond proactively to changing crime trends.

#The Approach
Leveraging anomaly detection with techniques like kernel density estimation and z-scores, this Anomaly Hot Spot tool focuses solely on identifying new crime spikes and sprees. This approach highlights areas experiencing unusual activity, helping officers locate and address emerging issues before they escalate.
